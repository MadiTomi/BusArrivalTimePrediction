# üöç Bus Arrival Time Prediction with Machine Learning

## üìå Project Overview
This project aims to predict bus arrival times using various machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM. The goal is to minimize prediction errors and improve the accuracy of estimated arrival times, contributing to a more efficient public transportation system.

## üìä Dataset
- The dataset contains historical bus arrival times, congestion levels, and timestamps.
- Data was preprocessed to handle missing values and extract meaningful time-based features.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Models Implemented
1. **Random Forest** - A tree-based ensemble learning method.
2. **XGBoost** - A gradient boosting algorithm optimized for speed and performance.
3. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** - A deep learning model specialized in time-series forecasting.

## üìà Visualizations
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Histogram of Bus Arrival Times
- **Description:** Displays the distribution of bus arrivals at different hours of the day.
- **Insights:** Peak arrival times are observed around 14:00, with lower frequencies during early morning and late-night hours.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Pairplot of Arrival Hour vs. Congestion Level
- **Description:** Shows relationships between arrival hour and congestion levels.
- **Insights:** Peak congestion corresponds to rush hours, affecting bus arrival times.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ RMSE Comparison Heatmap
- **Description:** Compares the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of different models.
- **Insights:** LSTM achieves the lowest RMSE (13.00), outperforming Random Forest (58.59) and XGBoost (59.58).
